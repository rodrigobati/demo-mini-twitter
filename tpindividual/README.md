# MiniTwitterJava

## Overview
MiniTwitterJava is a Java 23 project that implements a simplified version of a Twitter-like application using object-oriented programming principles. The project is structured as a classic Maven project, ensuring easy management of dependencies and build processes.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Maven directory layout:

```
MiniTwitterJava

│           └── unrn
│               └── model
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

- **src/main/java/unrn/model**: Contains the domain model classes that implement the business logic of the application.
